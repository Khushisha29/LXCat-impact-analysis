# A Comprehensive Knowledge Mining Pipeline for Extracting Domain Insights from LXCat-Cited Plasma Research Literature

A robust, open-source Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to extract real-world usage patterns of species, databases, and solvers from the full-text content of scientific literature citing the foundational LXCat papers. This project moves beyond traditional bibliometrics to provide deep, content-specific scientometric insights, quantifying the scientific impact of the Low-Temperature Plasma (LTP) community's data-sharing efforts. The pipeline automatically converts scientific PDFs to structured data, enabling researchers to analyze large document collections and generate actionable insights and trends.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The pipeline requires two distinct environments due to dependencies (specifically chemdataextractor's requirement for older Python versions).

* Main Pipeline Environment (Python 3.11+)

* Chemical Entity Extraction Environment (Python 3.9)

### Setup and Installation

1. Create main pipeline environment

```bash
conda create -n lxcat_main python=3.11
conda activate lxcat_main

pip install -r requirements_main.txt
```

2. Create Gas TM environment

```bash
mamba create -n lxcat_cde python=3.9
mamba activate lxcat_cde

pip install chemdataextractor
pip install -r cde_requirements.txt  
```

## 🔎 What This Pipeline Does

This fully automated pipeline processes raw scientific PDFs through multiple stages to generate structured output and visualizations.

1. **PDF to MD & JSON Conversion**

   * The pipeline begins by reading all input PDFs from `data/pdfs/` and convert each to a Markdown (`data/md/`) and a structured JSON (`data/jsons/`) representation. This dual-parsing approach ensures both clean text for NLP and structural metadata are preserved

2. **Clean Markdown Files**

   * Once PDFs are converted to Markdown, the pipeline cleans the files by removing tables, math expressions, extra whitespace, blank lines and formatting artifacts. This step produces standardized, noise-free Markdown files in `data/cleaned_mds/` that are ready for reliable NLP processing.


3. **MD to TXT Conversion**

   * Cleaned Markdown files are converted to plain text (`data/txts/`) for core NLP processing.

3. **Information Extraction: Chemical Species Extraction, Database Extraction, BOLSIG+ Solver Extraction**

   * From `data/txts/`, the pipeline extracts counts used for Bolsig+ processing, builds a database dictionary of databases used by LxCat Community, and chemical species dictionary containing counts/occurrences of LXCat species across documents. The results are kept ready for aggregation.

4. **JSONs → Country fetching**

   * The structural JSON outputs are parsed to reliably extract author affiliation and country information (using pycountry).

5. **Final aggregation and results**

   * All extracted information (from steps 1–4) is combined into a single Excel workbook: `results/data/results.xlsx`.
   * A `results/plots/` folder contains several automatically generated plots (histograms, bar charts of gas species frequency, country distribution, Bolsig+ related plots, etc.).

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Prepare input PDFs:

* Place all input PDFs into the `data/pdfs/` directory.

2. Run the Entire Pipeline:

```bash
# Ensure you are in the main environment for execution
conda activate lxcat_main
python main.py
```

If you prefer to run steps individually, open main.py and call the specific modularized functions in the `utils/` modules.

---

## 📂 Outputs

* `data/md/` — generated markdown files (one per PDF)
* `data/jsons/` — generated JSON metadata for each PDF
* `data/txts/` — cleaned plain-text files used for extraction
* `results/data/results.xlsx` — consolidated spreadsheet containing data for the four main entity groups (bolsig counts, database dictionary entries, gaseous species counts, country info).
* `results/plots/` — plots used for quick analysis and reporting.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

* Paths: You can change input/output paths by editing the path variables in `main.py`.

* Domain Adaptation: To adapt this pipeline for a different scientific domain (e.g., biology), you would primarily need to update the entity recognition and keyword lists used in the `utils/` modules (e.g., swapping ChemDataExtractor usage for a biology-specific entity recognizer).


---

## ✍️ Development Notes

* `main.py` orchestrates the five high-level steps; each task is delegated to a function within one of the six utils/*.py modules.
